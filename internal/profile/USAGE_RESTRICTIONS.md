// AI Usage Restriction for User Habit Profile
//
// The user habit profile in this package is strictly for explanation purposes only.
// - No machine learning, prediction, or inference is permitted.
// - The AI may use the profile summary only to explain observed user behavior.
// - The profile must never be used to trigger, automate, or take any action.
// - All updates to the profile must be based on confirmed user actions only.
//
// This ensures full determinism and transparency in user habit tracking.
